# Temperature Converter

## Description
The **Temperature Converter** is a simple web-based application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It is designed to help you practice **DOM manipulation**, **form handling**, and **basic calculations** in JavaScript. The project involves taking user input, selecting temperature units, and converting the value upon submission.

This project is inspired by the [Temperature Converter](https://roadmap.sh/projects/temperature-converter) project on roadmap.sh.

### Features:
- Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- The “Convert” button is only enabled when all fields are filled.
- Real-time conversion feedback is shown below the form.
- Responsive and clean UI design.

This project will help you gain experience with handling user input, conditionally enabling form elements, and performing simple calculations using JavaScript.

### Learning Objectives:
- **DOM manipulation**: Enable and disable form buttons based on input.
- **Form handling**: Process user input, validate form data, and provide feedback.
- **Basic calculations**: Implement conversion formulas between different temperature units.

This is an ideal project for beginners looking to practice JavaScript fundamentals.

## Installation

This project is easy to run locally, as it is built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/Yashi-Singh-9/temperature-converter.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the application.

No additional dependencies or installations are required.

## Usage

Enter the temperature value in the input field, select the units you'd like to convert **from** and **to**, and click "Convert."

The "Convert" button will only be enabled when:
- The temperature input field is filled.
- The "From Unit" and "To Unit" selections are made.

Once clicked, the tool will display the converted temperature below the form.

### Example:

Convert 100 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit:

- **Input:** 100°C
- **Output:** 212°F

Convert 0 Kelvin to Celsius:

- **Input:** 0K
- **Output:** -273.15°C

## Roadmap
Here are some potential future improvements:
- Add more temperature units, such as Rankine.
- Enable keyboard shortcuts for a better user experience.
- Add error handling for extreme values or unrealistic conversions.
